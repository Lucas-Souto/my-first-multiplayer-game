# my-first-multiplayer-game
After years of game development and C# programming, I decided to "tom√° vergonha na cara" and started to learn Networking for games!<br>
This is a little C# multiplayer game, based on <a href="https://github.com/filipedeschamps">@filipedeschamps</a>'s game challenge. <br>
