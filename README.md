# my-first-multiplayer-game
After years of game development and C# programming, I decided to "tomÃ¡ vergonha na cara" and started to learn Networking for games!<br>
This is a little C# multiplayer game, based on <a href="https://github.com/filipedeschamps">@filipedeschamps</a> game challenge. <br>
The game has some connection/communication bugs that I really need to learn how to fix into the next game... ðŸ˜…
