# my-first-multiplayer-game
A little C# multiplayer game, based on <a href="https://github.com/filipedeschamps">@filipedeschamps</a> game challenge. <br>
The game has some connection/communication bugs that I really need to learn how to fix into the next game... 😅

  * Online;
  * Screen warp (like pacman);
  * Two type of fruits to increase your score;
  * Admin dashboard.
