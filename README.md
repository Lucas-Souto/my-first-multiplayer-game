# my-first-multiplayer-game
After years of game development and C# programming, I decided to "tom√° vergonha na cara" and started to learn Networking for games!<br>
This is a little C# multiplayer game, based on <a href="https://github.com/filipedeschamps">@filipedeschamps</a> game challenge. <br>
This repository will have 3 implementations:

# Walking Squares: - Done!
 * Admin dashboard (server);
 * Walking squares with scores;
 * Screen warp (like pacman);
 * Two type of fruits to increase your score.

# Walking Squares - Remake:
This version will focuse on:
 * Destroy the previous game's bugs;
 * Make different rooms for each group of players.

# Hungry Mices:
 * Account system;
 * Skins;
 * Animations;
 * Leaderboard;
 * Private and public rooms (with different sizes);
 * Obstacles.
